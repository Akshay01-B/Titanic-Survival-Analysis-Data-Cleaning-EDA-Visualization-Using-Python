# Titanic Survival Analysis ‚Äì Data Cleaning, EDA & Visualization

## üö¢ Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic Titanic disaster in 1912. The goal is to clean the data, analyze key questions, and visualize the results using Python libraries.

## ‚úÖ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading  
The dataset was loaded from Kaggle‚Äôs Titanic competition (`train.csv`).

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Missing values in the `Age` column were filled with the median age.  
- Rows with missing `Embarked` values were dropped.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key questions addressed:
- Who survived more: males or females?  
- Did passenger class affect survival chances?  
- What was the survival rate by different age groups?

### 4. Data Visualization  
Visualized insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib:
- Bar chart showing survival rate by gender.  
- Bar chart showing survival rate by passenger class.  
- Histogram showing the distribution of passenger ages.

### 5. Conclusion  
Findings from the analysis:
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.  
- First-class passengers had a greater chance of survival than other classes.  
- Children had higher survival rates compared to adults and seniors.
